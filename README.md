# SECRET-FRIEND
A Full Stack project for you to share your secret friend's gift. You will just need to place your file `.env` in the root folder of the backend with the following information: `MONGODB_URI= "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<database>"`and that's it ^^, it will be working. And of course, don't forget to give these two commands in both terminals: "npm i" and "npm run dev" respectively. See it on [Vercel]().
